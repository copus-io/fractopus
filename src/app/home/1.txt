              Today's internet is an ancient ocean teeming with single-cell
              content. These single cells float around, get discovered by
              content consumers, and gather nutrients (exposure & financial
              income) for their growth. They form colonies to more effectively
              collect nutrition. While these colonies can become large and
              influential, they remain merely quantitative accumulations of
              single cells instead of complex organisms. To evolve into complex
              organisms, the single cells must start establishing connections
              and sharing nutrients. Such a transformation will give rise to a
              new creature in the internet ocean â€” Fractopus.

              Fractopus is a unique type of octopus that expands in a fractal
              structure. Unlike traditional octopuses with eight tentacles, a
              fractopus can have varying numbers of tentacles. Each tentacle is
              itself a self-similar fractopus. The size and maturity of a
              fractopus are gauged by the number of its tentacles. A mature
              fractopus can have thousands of tentacles and thus be connected to
              countless other fractal-fractopuses. A fractal-fractopus can even
              outgrow its source, provided it adds more tentacles.

              The term "opus" in "Fractopus" signifies that it's a content
              creature. It grows new tentacles only when new single cells
              (content) attach to it. Rather than seizing the single cells, a
              fractopus lures them by providing exposure, enabling them to be
              more easily discovered by content consumers. In return, the single
              cell commits to channeling a portion of its future nutrients to
              the fractopus. The size of this portion can be set either by the
              single cell or predefined by the fractopus as a joining criterion.
              A larger portion typically equates to better exposure.

              A single cell can link to multiple fractopuses and negotiate
              distinct agreements with each. These agreements foster natural
              selection among fractopuses because single cells will only connect
              with content that can offer valuable exposure. This encourages
              fractopuses to become valuable content providers and actively
              promote themselves. In doing so, they attract more single cells to
              become their tentacles, benefiting from their nutrients and that
              of their tentacles.

              A fractopus can capture nutrients with any part of its body since
              each nerve-ending in its tentacles is also a fractopus. Upon
              acquiring nutrients, it automatically funnels it to all connected
              fractopuses, retaining the remainder for itself. Most often, a
              source-fractopus also has its own sources and agreements. The
              nutrients are thus distributed according to these agreements,
              branching out until they flow through every fractopus directly or
              indirectly linked to the original capture.

              To ensure optimal efficiency, the nutrient flow should be as
              frictionless as possible. Likewise, content and agreements should
              be safeguarded from abuse and manipulation to maintain the health
              of the fractopus. Blockchain technology emerges as the best
              candidate to serve as the fractopus' nervous and immune systems,
              as well as its guarantee of freedom. A faster, more frictionless
              nervous system enables better movement, attracting more single
              cells. Additionally, a robust immune system is crucial for the
              secure storage of content and agreements. Also, a fractopus is not
              meant to be confined to an aquarium; it should enjoy freedom in a
              decentralized internet ocean.

              We can expect to see various fractopuses evolving in different
              areas of the internet ocean. As content creatures, they might
              focus on different themes, occasionally finding synergies. This
              allows for a "tentacle-shake," akin to a handshake but more
              complex. A tentacle-shake can connect multiple tentacles, merging
              fractopuses into a unified organism. Although this strengthens
              them by combining their nutritional, nervous, and immune systems,
              it also exposes them to each other's vulnerabilities. To mitigate
              this, a fractopus can sever its tentacles if they become redundant
                or compromised.
